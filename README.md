# i18n-TMP-Localization
This is basically the original Daniel Erdmann version that updated Text objects to a specific language based on a key added to each text game object (textbox, button text, etc.). However, since the Textbox and Button etc. have become legacy items, it was necessary to add a script to deal with the new Text Mesh Pro (TMP) versions.
